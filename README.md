# dot-files-archive
Backup/sync of my configuration files.

I used a git root at ~ so I could sync without copying or hard links; that worked well for a while but git seems to have added an absolute path somewhere. Rather than work it out and have to continually pay attention, I'm now going to keep git's root in the repo folder.

See https://github.com/rjframe/dot-files for the current repo.
